# Welcome

This is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) application framework built for power.

Powerstone targets two types of applications Web and API servers.

For serving API endpoints we use [restify](http://restify.com) and [express](expressjs.com) for
regular Web apps. Why? The two are similliar yet bare enough to have
some of the same setup steps involved.

Powerstone was developed to support turning a Web app into an api server without too much
fuss.

See [installing](guide/installing.md) for how to setup.
